# suicide-rate-visualization

This project takes data from the world health organization on national suicide rates and other possibly correlating variables and graphs them using an interactive visualization tool called bokeh. This was a project for an information visualization class in my masters program where we were tasked with creating a few visualizations. I decided to make one of my visualizations interactive as it would allow the user to explore different variables at the same time. Attached is a report written about the creation process and findings.

## Bokeh

Bokeh is a python package that allows users to create interactive visualization that utilize an online server. You can find documentation on there website [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=bokeh+python&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS970US970&sxsrf=APwXEdd5SZnZDAH372ci-3ELtPt3AESkCw%3A1681476967859&ei=Z005ZNGONKejptQP-Y2TuAQ&ved=0ahUKEwiR3vfqtan-AhWnkYkEHfnGBEcQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=bokeh+python&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICAAQgAQQsQMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIKCAAQgAQQFBCHAjIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoLCC4QgAQQxwEQrwFKBAhBGABQ9wNY_AlgyQpoAXABeACAAVaIAYcEkgEBN5gBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp).
